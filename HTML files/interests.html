          <h2>Research Interests</h2>

            width="300px" vspace="10"> <strong>Problem classes:</strong> My
          main research interests revolve around the development of solution
          algorithms for nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problems. Specific
          classes of such problems of particular interest include bilevel
          optimization and mathematical programs with equilibrium or variational
          inequality constraints. Bilevel programs are optimization problems
          with a hierarchical structure involving two levels of decision making,
          respectively controlled by a leader and a follower. They represent a
          very powerful tool for modelling a large number of real-world
          problems, including problems from data science, economics, and
          engineering. These problems are however very difficult to solve, and
          most attempts have been limited to the case where reactions of the
          follower to choices by the leader are predictable. With my
          collaborators, I am currently developing numerical algorithms that can
          deal with more realistic situations where the follower has a freedom
          of choice while reacting to decisions by the leader. <br>

            width="300px" vspace="10"> <strong>Numerical techniques:</strong>
          For&nbsp; optimization problems involving nonconvex and nonsmooth
          functions, solutions methods should take these specific features into
          account to work efficiently. Because of the nonconvexity, detecting
          global optimal solutions becomes quite difficult. Hence, to be able to
          solve problems of reasonable size, my work involves the development of
          algorithms that can generate stationary points which in turn have the
          potential to be locally optimal. Particular numerical techniques of
          interest include Newton-, (augmented) Lagrangian-, and smoothing-type
          methods. The latter class of techniques can sometimes be very
          efficient in dealing with problems involving nonsmooth functions. Over
          the last few years, I have also developed a great amount of interest
          in variational analysis, which can provide some handy tools for
          mathematically characterizing optimal solutions of nonconvex and
          nonsmooth optimization problems. <br>

            vspace="10"> <strong>Areas of real world applications:</strong>
          Application areas of current interest include data science, network
          pricing, and electricity markets. In data science, a standard tool to
          proceed with model selection tasks is grid search, which performs very
          well on training problems involving just a small number of
          hyperparameters. I am working on designing numerical methods which
          have the potential to perform significantly better than grid search or
          other related techniques for training problems with multiple
          hyparameters. A related ongoing project is being funded by <a href="https://www.das-ltd.co.uk/">
            Decision Analysis Services Ltd</a> with Anthony Dunn working as PhD
          student (2018-2022) and Nick Barton as MSc student (2017-2018). On
          network pricing, I am currently collaborating with the Streets
          Analysis Team at Transport for London (TfL) within the PhD project of
          Laura Murray (2016-2019) and TfL will be sponsoring a MSc project on
          the subject in 2018-2019. </div>
